# stringdist can be useful for all kinds of string manipulation
# it measures the difference between two strings
# One example: replacing the short version of a title with the complete one, without 
# replacing each string individually

example:
library(stringdist)

books <- data.frame("id" = seq(1, 6),
                    "title_short" =  c("jekyllhyde", "thebiglebowski", "jekyllhyde", "crimeandpunishment",
                                       "crimeandpunishment", "hamonrye"))

booktitles_fixed <- c("dr jekyll and mr hyde", "the big lebowski", "crime and punishment", "ham on rye") 

books <- books %>% 
  mutate(title_long = booktitles_fixed[apply(stringdistmatrix(title_short, booktitles_fixed),
                                        1, which.min)])
                                        
# also possible using parameters like maxDist, minDist etc                                        
                                        
# et voila, the short titles are nicely aligned with the long titles
